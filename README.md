Welcome to the **MOpS particle simulator**. This program has been developed by the Computational Modelling Group at the University of Cambridge under the supervision of Prof Markus Kraft.

## Description

The **MOpS particle simulator** uses stochastic numerical methods to solve population balance equations. A weighting time algorithm is used to sample the processes that produce and transform molecules and particles in the model.

It has been used to simulate:
 - The production of titanium dioxide particles from titanium tetraisopropoxide (TTIP) and titanium tetrachloride.
 - The production of silicon particles from the thermal decomposition of silane.
 - The formation and growth of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and carbonaceous particles associated with hydrocarbon combustion.

The stochastic numerical methods enable the use of detailed particle models. For example, the carbonaceous particle model describes the chemical composition of each PAH in the system, and tracks which PAHs belong to which primary particles and which primary particles belong to which aggregates. The use of such a model allows the simulation of quantities that can be directly compared to experimental data.
