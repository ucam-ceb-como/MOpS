  File purpose:
    Stochastic mechanism for Sweep.  The mechanism holds all the processes
    which can be enacted on a system with a particle ensemble.  It also holds
    auxilliary info which defines how those processes work.

    The mechanism class defines routines for calculating process rates and perform
    a process.  It also contains the Linear Process Deferment Algorithm (LPDA) for
    updating linear processes that have been removed from the stochastic jump process.

    The mechanism also defines particle components and additional particle values.  Particle
    values are particle properties which can be changed by processes, but which are not 
    components, therefore they do not contribute to particle mass.
